    <p>This is a speedpaint of a well-known singer put into a cartoonish art style.</p>    
          
</p>I have put three kinds of drawings to explain that i have had trouble with what kind of style i want.So i used other  sources to prove that i am wiling to be able do all of those kinds but i can not settle for one.
</p>So what can you do? My thought which is somewhat basic yet not stupid. It's somehow combinig all the techinques and creating a whole new style.And eventually, ill figure out how to.Maybe its areadly called something,but ill never know till i try.
